Personal data we collect
________________________________________
FlowDynamics collects data from you, through our interactions with you and through our products. You provide some of this data directly, and we get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use, and experiences with our products. The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with FlowDynamics and the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the products and features you use. We also obtain data about you from third parties.
You have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you share. When we ask you to provide personal data, you can decline. Our products require some personal data to provide you with a service. If you choose not to provide data required to provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature. Likewise, where we need to collect personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter into the contract; or if this relates to an existing product you’re using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. We will notify you if this is the case at the time. Where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalization that use such data will not work for you.
How we use personal data
________________________________________
FlowDynamics uses the data we collect to provide you with rich, interactive experiences. In particular, we use data to:
•	Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support. It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.
•	Improve and develop our products.
•	Personalize our products and make recommendations.
•	Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers.
We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.
In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two FlowDynamics products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.
Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing. Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods. For example, our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI), which we think of as a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and assist in decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what people do. To build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made. For example, we manually review short snippets of a small sampling of voice data we have taken steps to de-identify to improve our speech services, such as recognition and translation.
Reasons we share personal data
________________________________________
We share your personal data with your consent or to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized. We also share data when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to maintain the security of our products; and to protect the rights and property of FlowDynamics and its customers.
How to access and control your personal data
________________________________________
You can also make choices about the collection and use of your data by FlowDynamics. You can control your personal data that FlowDynamics has obtained, and exercise your data protection rights, by contacting FlowDynamics. In some cases, your ability to access or control your personal data will be limited, as required or permitted by applicable law. How you can access or control your personal data will also depend on which products you use. For example, you can:
•	Control the use of your data for interest-based advertising from FlowDynamics by visiting our opt-out page.
•	Choose whether you wish to receive promotional emails, SMS messages, telephone calls, and postal mail from FlowDynamics.
•	Access and clear some of your data through the FlowDynamics privacy dashboard.
Not all personal data processed by FlowDynamics can be accessed or controlled via the tools above. If you want to access or control personal data processed by FlowDynamics that is not available via the tools above or directly through the FlowDynamics products you use, you can always contact FlowDynamics at the address in the How to contact us section.
